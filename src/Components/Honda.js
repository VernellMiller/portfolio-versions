          This was a fun yet challenging design project. The original was
          designed in 3D using Unreal Engine by 3D Artist Coreray. Coreray does
          great work and I was inspired to try to capture the 3D renders and
          bring it to life in the 2D space. I designed this using Adobe
          Illustrator.

          This project help bolster my pen tool skills along with my skills
          using the perspective grid tool. Using both really brought life to
          this 2D rendition and adding the shadows and highlights blends it all
          come together smoothly. It was great practice for me and I enjoyed it
          a ton.
