          The TownShip is a concept idea inspired by a post seen on
          @a24illustration. My concept is a little town road that features four
          separate parks at the towns center that make up one large theme park
          styled park. Strategically placed along the road and alongside the
          parks are the residential buildings, a combination of Apartments and
          Condominiums. Scattered amongst the parks and residential buildings
          are a bevy of shops, grocery, convenience, and department stores for
          the residents to enjoy.

          This design was created in Adobe Illustrator. I enjoy working in
          Illustrator and this project gave me another opportunity to continue
          practicing in Graphic Design. I do have further plans to take this
          design further by adding more 2D designs. However, I would love to
          build a 3D concept as well. To be continued ➡➡➡.
